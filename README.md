# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Film Data Using PostgreSQL

## Project Description:
In this project, I will apply my SQL skills to perform exploratory data analysis on the "inidata" database, 
which contains information about films, people, reviews, and roles. 

The project will focus on retrieving, filtering, 
and analyzing data to answer real-life business questions related to the film industry.

## Project Objectives:
- Apply SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data from the "inidata" database.
- Gain practical experience in using SQL for data analysis.
- Answer real-life business questions using SQL.
- Present findings in a clear and organized manner.

**NOTE:**

- **FILMS Data using PostgreSQL.txt** contains my Query codes for this project
- **films_data_presentation** is a PDF file that contains the original screenshots of my queries, results and Analysis

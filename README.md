# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Film Data Using PostgreSQL and PowerBi for visualization

## Project Description:
In this project, I will apply my SQL skills to perform exploratory data analysis on the "inidata" database, 
which contains the following tables; films, people, reviews, and roles. 

The project will focus on retrieving, filtering, 
and analyzing data to answer real-life business questions related to the film industry.

**Disclaimer** This is not a real company as we know inidata base is complile by DAHEL TECH for learning purposes
